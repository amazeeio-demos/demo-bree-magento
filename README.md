#Lagoon Magento 2 example

Please note that the Magento 2 README can be round at [./PROJECT_README.md](./PROJECT_README.md)

This is a highly experimental Lagoonization of Magento, use at your own risk while it is in active development.

PR's welcome.

# About the volume mounts

As we've had some issues with symlinks in Magento (still under investigation), the simplest approach was to mount all persistent storage under `app/etc/`

This allows for installing Magento on Lagoon's infrastructure, however, we're mounting `app/etc` as a persistent volume, which means that any changes to `app/etc`'s files that aren't generated by Magento itself will need to be manually copied into `app/etc`.

When we build the image from your source code, we're currently copying the contents of the `app/etc` directory to `/repo/app/etc` - this makes the files available to you so that you can, if need, copy changes into the `app/etc` volume.


# Installation

Once you have set up your project on Lagoon (or locally) you will want to run an installation


Installing locally, you'll want to remove the `base-url-secure` argument below.

```
/app/bin/magento setup:install --base-url="${LAGOON_ROUTE:-http://magento.docker.amazee.io}" \
--base-url-secure="${LAGOON_ROUTE:-https://magento.docker.amazee.io}" \
--db-host="${MARIADB_HOST:-mariadb}" \
--db-name="${MARIADB_DATABASE:-lagoon}" \
--db-user="${MARIADB_USERNAME:-lagoon}" \
--db-password="${MARIADB_PASSWORD:-lagoon}" \
--admin-firstname="Admin" \
--admin-lastname="User" \
--admin-email="admin@example.com" \
--admin-user="admin" \
--admin-password="admin123" \
--elasticsearch-host="elasticsearch" \
--elasticsearch-port=9200 \
--use-rewrites=1 \
--search-engine=elasticsearch7

```
